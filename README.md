This project is about a "flex slider" built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features four slides: "Home," "About," "Price," and "Contact," which display different information when hovered over. The design uses Flexbox and animations to ensure that when the user hovers over a slide, it expands and reveals more details.

Key technologies used:

HTML: Provides the structure of the project, including the slider, text, and form elements.
CSS: Controls the layout and design of the page, utilizing Flexbox, transitions, and media queries to make the slider responsive on both mobile and desktop devices.
JavaScript: Manages the hover effects on the slides and the loading spinner functionality.
The project consists of different sections (Home, About, Price, Contact), and JavaScript ensures that when you hover over a slide, it expands and displays its content dynamically.
